# Steam

A digital distribution platform for purchasing and playing video games.
It offers a vast library of games, community features, and cloud saving.

## Custom CLI flags

By default, Steam is set to use `-bigpicture` to open up in Big Picture mode.
You can override that (or pass any other flags) by setting the env variable `STEAM_STARTUP_FLAGS`.
See the full list of available flags [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Command_line_options)
